Advanced Section (Optional)
This project was inspired by my fascination with Egyptian history and its incredible landmarks. The biggest technical challenge was integrating the images with responsive design while ensuring optimal load times. I also had fun learning new JavaScript techniques for interactivity and dynamic content generation.

In future iterations, I plan to add:

Interactive maps for each city.
A quiz feature to test users' knowledge of Egyptian landmarks.
Language options for international visitors.
